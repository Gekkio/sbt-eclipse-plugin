This version of sbt-eclipse-plugin has been superseded by [SBT Eclipse integration](http://dumbo.assembla.com/spaces/sbt-eclipse-integration/wiki)
===============================================================================

[SBT Eclipse integration](http://dumbo.assembla.com/spaces/sbt-eclipse-integration/wiki) is a new project that is a collaboration between me and Stefan Langer. I'll be concentrating my work on that project and won't be updating this plugin anymore.

SBT Eclipse integration is still missing some features from this plugin but should be overall more robust. *(25.08.2010): There has been some discussion of integrating SBT Eclipse integration within Scala IDE. If you are currently using sbt-eclipse-plugin, you might want to wait for a couple of weeks before migrating to SBTEI because some changes might occur if we become a part of Scala IDE*

The old update site is still up and will be for a while, but please try to migrate to SBT Eclipse integration.

### Old update site (will no longer be available in 2011)
