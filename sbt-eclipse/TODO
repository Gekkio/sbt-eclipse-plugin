+ Workspace resolution (M2Eclipse-like)
  + Should be now possible with SBT natures
+ Support for multiple scala versions
  + Scala eclipse plugin probably won't like it
  + At least we should choose one scala version (for choosing the correct lib_managed subdirectory)
+ WTP support
  + Can now be developed in a separate plugin because the plugin has a master feature
+ Reflection-based reading SBT project files
  + Might be hard due to complex classloading
+ Global and per-project preferences
+ Automatic dependency refresh
